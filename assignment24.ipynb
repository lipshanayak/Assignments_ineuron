    "# 1.What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions?\n",
    "# The relationship between def statements and lambda expressions is that they both define functions in Python,\n",
    "# but they differ in syntax and usage.\n",
    "# def statements are used to define named functions with a block of code. They have a more comprehensive syntax and can include\n",
    "# multiple statements, control structures, and a return statement. They are typically used for more complex functions that \n",
    "# require multiple lines of code and have a specific name for reuse.\n",
    "# Lambda expressions, also known as anonymous functions, are defined using the lambda keyword and have a more compact syntax.\n",
    "# They can only consist of a single expression and automatically return the result of that expression. \n",
    "# Lambda expressions are often used for simple, one-time functions or as arguments for higher-order functions like map(),.\n",
    "# filter(), and reduce().\n"

    "# The benefits of using lambda expressions in Python include:\n",
    "# Conciseness: Lambda expressions allow you to define small functions in a single line of code, making the code more readable and concise.\n",
    "# Convenience: They eliminate the need for writing a separate function definition for simple functions that are only used once.\n",
    "# Flexibility: Lambda expressions can be used as anonymous functions or as arguments to higher-order functions, enabling more flexible programming constructs.\n",
    "# Improved code readability: In some cases, using a lambda expression can make the code more readable by expressing the intention of the function directly where it is used."
